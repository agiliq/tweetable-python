convert repeated spaces to one space
====================================

.. code-block:: python

    import re; re.sub(r"[ ]+", ' ', 'this    sentence          has              non-uniform      spaces')

The above snippet clears out the repeated spaces in a text and replaces it with single space.
re is a regular expression module to find more than one occurrences of space with '[ ]+'.
